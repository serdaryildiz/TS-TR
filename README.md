## About Dataset

The Turkish Scene Text Recognition (TS-TR) dataset was primarily developed to fill the gap in non-English text recognition resources, specifically addressing the unique challenges presented by the Turkish language, such as special characters and diacritics. This dataset mirrors real-world conditions with texts displayed in various fonts, sizes, orientations, and complex backgrounds from multiple urban and rural environments. Such diversity ensures the training of models that can generalize across different scenarios, including varying lighting conditions and complex visual layouts.
